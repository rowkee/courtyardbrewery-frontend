# Courtyard Brewery - Full Stack Website for a Microbrewery

## TL;DR
This was the final project of the course, the requirement were as follows:
* Be a full-stack **Django/React** application.
* Connect to and perform data operations on a **PostgreSQL** database (the default SQLLite3 database is not acceptable).
* If consuming a third party API (OPTIONAL), have at least **one data entity** (Model) in addition to the built-in User model. The related entity can be either a **one-to-many (1:M) or a many-to-many (M:M)** relationship. 
* Have **full-CRUD data operations** across any combination of the app's models 
‚òê **Authenticate users using Django's built-in authentication**.

For my final project I wanted to work on something that I knew a real business could benefit from. Having worked with the Courtyard Brewery recently I knew they were in need of a website, one where they could manage the content and stock easily. 

The app was designed and built in 6 days. The deployed version can be found [HERE](https://courtyardbrewery-frontend-production.up.railway.app/).

## Process

### Planning
I used a Miro board [HERE](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNfP-OMU=/?share_link_id=167399156126)to plan what I want to do with this project.

Knowing that this project was likely to go live and be used by the Brewery, I wanted to get their input and feedback early on. I created wireframes that I could easily share with the Brewery to get their feedback on. 

Once I had outline the basic functionality and information I needed, I created the ERD diagrams I needed. 

For each increment I would write pseudocode, again with the purpose of helping me focus on what exactly I wanted to achieve with each piece of code I was writing.
